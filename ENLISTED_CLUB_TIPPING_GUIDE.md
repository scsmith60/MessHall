# Enlisted Club Tipping - How It Works

## üí∞ For Tippers (Session Participants)

### How to Tip:
1. Join an active Enlisted Club cooking session
2. Tap the **"Tip Host"** button
3. Enter amount ($0.50 - $500.00)
4. Optionally add a message
5. Complete payment via Stripe payment sheet
6. Host receives your tip!

### Where Your Money Goes:
When you tip $10.00:
- **Stripe charges your card:** $10.00
- **$9.00 (90%)** ‚Üí Goes directly to the host's Stripe Connect account ‚Üí Their bank account
- **$1.00 (10%)** ‚Üí Goes to MessHall's Stripe account (platform fee) ‚Üí MessHall's bank account
- Money is transferred to bank accounts automatically by Stripe (usually within 2-7 business days)

**Important:** The 10% fee comes FROM the tip amount - MessHall doesn't pay anything. You (the tipper) pay the full $10, which gets split automatically.

### Payment Security:
- All payments processed securely through Stripe
- Your card details never touch our servers
- Stripe handles all PCI compliance

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Tables:
- `enlisted_club_tips`: Records all tip transactions
- `profiles.stripe_account_id`: Stores each host's Stripe Connect account ID

### Payment Flow:
1. Client calls `enlisted-club-tip` edge function
2. Function validates session, participant, and recipient
3. Function checks if host has `stripe_account_id`
4. Function creates Stripe Payment Intent with:
   - `transfer_data.destination` = host's Stripe account
   - `application_fee_amount` = 10% of tip amount
5. Returns `client_secret` to client
6. Client completes payment via Stripe payment sheet
7. Stripe automatically transfers funds to host's account

### Stripe Connect Setup:
Hosts use Stripe Connect Standard accounts, which allows:
- Direct transfers to their bank account
- Automatic payouts (Stripe handles the transfer)
- Full Stripe dashboard access
- Tax reporting via Stripe
