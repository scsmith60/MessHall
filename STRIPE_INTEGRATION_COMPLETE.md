# Stripe Integration Complete! âœ…

I've re-implemented the complete Stripe payment flow for Enlisted Club tipping, including monetization messages and routing. Here's what was added:

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### 1. Stripe React Native SDK Integration
- âœ… Installed `@stripe/stripe-react-native` package
- âœ… Added `StripeProvider` to app root (`app/_layout.tsx`)
- âœ… Added Stripe publishable key support in `lib/env.ts`

### 2. Payment Sheet Integration
- âœ… Implemented full Stripe payment sheet in `app/enlisted-club/[id].tsx`
- âœ… Handles payment initialization with `client_secret`
- âœ… Presents native payment sheet for card entry
- âœ… Handles payment success, cancellation, and errors
- âœ… Shows appropriate user feedback messages

### 3. Monetization Screen Updates
- âœ… Shows Stripe account setup status
- âœ… Displays "Ready" badge when Stripe is connected
- âœ… Shows setup instructions when Stripe is not connected
- âœ… Added button to get Stripe onboarding link
- âœ… Better routing and messaging for monetization status

## ðŸ”§ Setup Required

### Step 1: Get Stripe Keys

1. **Publishable Key (for React Native):**
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ **Developers â†’ API keys**
   - Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
   - Add to your `.env` file:
     ```
     EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
     ```

2. **Secret Key (for Edge Function):**
   - In Stripe Dashboard â†’ **Developers â†’ API keys**
   - Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)
   - Add to Supabase Edge Function secrets:
     - Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ **Edge Functions â†’ enlisted-club-tip â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets**
     - Add secret: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = your secret key

### Step 2: Test the Integration

1. **Test Mode First:**
   - Use Stripe test cards (e.g., `4242 4242 4242 4242`)
   - Use any future expiry date (e.g., `12/25`)
   - Use any 3-digit CVC (e.g., `123`)
   - Use any ZIP code

2. **Test Flow:**
   - Create or join an Enlisted Club session
   - Click "Tip Host" button
   - Enter tip amount ($0.50 - $500.00)
   - Complete payment via Stripe payment sheet
   - Verify tip appears in recent tips list

## ðŸ’° How It Works

### For Tippers:
1. User taps "Tip Host" in active session
2. Enters tip amount and optional message
3. Edge function creates Stripe Payment Intent
4. Payment sheet opens for card entry
5. Payment processes through Stripe
6. Tip recorded in database
7. Host receives 90% (platform takes 10%)

### For Hosts:
1. Apply for monetization (Profile â†’ Monetization)
2. Get approved by admin
3. Complete Stripe Connect onboarding
4. Receive `stripe_account_id` in profile
5. Can now receive tips during sessions!

## ðŸ“± Files Modified

- `app/_layout.tsx` - Added StripeProvider
- `app/enlisted-club/[id].tsx` - Payment sheet implementation
- `app/(account)/monetization.tsx` - Stripe status display
- `lib/env.ts` - Stripe publishable key config
- `package.json` - Added @stripe/stripe-react-native

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- âœ… Publishable key is safe for client-side (already in env.ts)
- âœ… Secret key stays server-side (Edge Function only)
- âœ… Payment intents created server-side
- âœ… Card details never touch your servers (handled by Stripe)

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Add Stripe Keys:**
   - Add `EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` to `.env`
   - Add `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` to Supabase secrets

2. **Test Payment Flow:**
   - Use Stripe test mode
   - Test successful payments
   - Test cancellations
   - Test errors

3. **Go Live:**
   - Switch to live mode keys when ready
   - Update environment variables
   - Test with real cards (small amounts first!)
