# Stripe Setup Guide for Enlisted Club Tipping

## 💰 Who Pays What?

### The 10% Platform Fee:
**Answer: The 10% fee comes FROM the tip amount, not from Stripe or anyone else.**

When someone tips $10.00:
- **$1.00 (10%)** → Goes to **MessHall** (your platform)
- **$9.00 (90%)** → Goes to the **host** (session creator)

**How it works technically:**
- Stripe charges the tipper the **full $10.00**
- Stripe automatically splits it:
  - Takes $1.00 as `application_fee_amount` → MessHall's Stripe account
  - Transfers $9.00 to host's Stripe Connect account → their bank account

**MessHall doesn't pay anything** - the fee is deducted from what the tipper pays.
